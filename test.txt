Bob lived in an average town. The streets were normal, the buildings looked normal, and the people acted normal. Bob had lived there for a long time, and nothing about it ever surprised him.

Every morning, Bob woke up at a reasonable time. He got out of bed, stretched, and put on clothes that were neither new nor old. He ate a regular breakfast and drank a normal amount of coffee. It tasted fine.

After breakfast, Bob usually sat at his table for a few minutes, thinking about simple things like bills, chores, and what he might do later. Most days, he didn’t decide anything special.

One day, Bob went outside for a walk. The weather was fine. Bob walked down the sidewalk at a steady pace. A few people passed by. They looked ordinary. Bob nodded at one of them. They nodded back. It was the usual kind of interaction.

Bob walked to the small park near the center of town. The park had a few trees, some grass, and a couple of benches. Bob chose a bench and sat down. The bench was normal. It felt like every other bench Bob had ever sat on.

While sitting, Bob looked around. Nothing stood out. A person walked a dog. A car went by. A leaf fell from a tree. Bob watched these things for a while without thinking much about them.

Eventually, Bob got up and walked back home at his usual pace. He unlocked his door, stepped inside, and went back to doing normal tasks. He washed a few dishes. He folded some laundry. He checked the time once or twice.

When evening came, Bob made a simple dinner and ate it quietly. The food tasted okay. After that, he sat on his couch for a bit before deciding to go to bed.
